# Manchester United Midfield Analysis (2025–2026)

This project provides a data-driven comparison of Manchester United midfielders Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro during the 2025–26 Premier League season under Rúben Amorim’s 3-4-3 system.

The goal is to evaluate:
- Attacking vs defensive contributions
- Ball-winning vs ball-progression responsibilities
- Role balance within Amorim’s double-pivot
- Efficiency and effectiveness of the midfield partnership

A player radar chart is used to visualize and compare their statistical profiles using publicly available performance metrics. This serves as an introductory football analytics project demonstrating data cleaning, metric selection, visualization, and tactical interpretation.
